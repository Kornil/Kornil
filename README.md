Hi, I’m Francesco 👋  

**Lead Software Engineer @ OpenText**  

I build clean, type-safe libraries and tools for modern web applications. I'm passionate about elegant API design and improving developer experience.

I also enjoy sharing knowledge through teaching and presentations to help developers write simple, maintainable code.  

Currently maintaining **[use-stateful-promise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-use-stateful-promise)**, a lightweight, cancelable async-state hook for React.
